# stock-tracker
The purpose of this application is to help users keep track of their favorite stock tickers in the US Stock Market. Users can set a low or high threshold price for each stock ticker, and if the application detects that the current price of that stock falls below or over a certain threshold, it will send a notification to the user.

Please see my blog post and screenshots of this app at: https://bryanleehuang.com/2020/09/08/stock-tracker-android-app/
